## Techno-Activism 3rd Monday

Techno-Activism Third Mondays (TA3M) is an informal meetup designed to connect software creators and activists who are interested in censorship, surveillance, and open technology. Currently, TA3M are held in various cities throughout the world, with many more launching in the near future.

TA3M is explicitly informal and open. You are invited to hack the process, ask questions, and be critical. You are very welcome to join in if you have something you want to share or discuss.

Seattle has one of the longest running [ta3m](https://seattleprivacy.org/ta3m/) chapters, operating since 2013.
